# Introduction

**Attackers!**
Your first mission is to conduct recon and secure initial access to the NMBS system. To do this, you'll leverage OSINT* (Open Source Intelligence) to pinpoint the right target. We've intercepted critical intel: the NMBS ticketing system is managed by a company called Cyberhell. Use this information to uncover the developer's nameâ€”this could be the key to infiltrating their defenses.

*Remember, **OSINT** is all about exploiting publicly available information to uncover potential attack vectors, whether by directly targeting your objective or by leveraging a supply chain attack.

Your success in this phase will determine the outcome of the operation. Proceed with precision. If you get stuck or need guidance, feel free to ask the instructor for a hint!

Since developers are known for their weak security knowledge, we might find some classic vulnerabilities in their work. Typical web-based attacks are listed in the OWASP top 10, like injection, cross-site scripting, etc.

Begin by exploring the web. Look for weak points in the digital armor and gather any information that might lead us to the builders of this fortress. This knowledge could be the key to taking down their defenses. 

**Breach the database and extract end-user data. This repository may contain valuable accounts or critical intelligence that can be leveraged for further exploitation.**
