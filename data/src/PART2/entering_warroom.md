3. Once connected to Warroom portal (Guacamole), under “All Connections” you should have 2 VM’s listed:

    - **Attacker Kali**: This machine will be your weapon as the attacker. 
    All offensive operations will be launched from here. 


    - **Defender Windows**: This machine will be your stronghold as the defender.
    Your mission is to fortify, monitor, and repel any incoming attacks.
