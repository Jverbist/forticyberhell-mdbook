# Attacker, Verify the Environment


*Attacker*, access the Warroom Portal (guacamole), and launch `KALIX` (where `X` is your student number).


<div class="info">

Note: You should be automatically logged in as user `kali`. The password is again the Cyberhell password: `Cyberhell2025$!`

</div>

1. Verify the `cyberhell` directory is located on the Kali Linux. 

    Open a terminal on `KaliX` and run the following command:

    ```
    cd cyberhell
    ```

    Check the content within the `cyberhell` directory.
    ```
    ls
    ```

    You should see a file name `sliver-client`.

    **If you don't, please ask help to instructor!**

1. **Your command center is live**, and the gateway to cyberhell stands open before you. 

    This is no ordinary mission—there’s no tolerance for weakness here. If you can’t keep up, you’ll be left to die!
