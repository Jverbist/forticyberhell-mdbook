# Unleashing Hellfire to OT

**Attackers, prepare for the next stage of our operation in the depths of cyberhell.**

Now that we’ve successfully planted our account within the OT group for remote access, the next challenge is connecting our way into their fortress. 

We know the target is running a jumpstation. Countless third parties constantly access the jumpstation for maintenance of OT environments. We just now need to find the path. Let’s uncover the address we need to connect to. 

Once we have the necessary information, it’s time to probe for weaknesses. Scan for open ports, and attempt to establish an RDP connection using the credentials we’ve planted. This will be our key to accessing the jumpstation.

Your ultimate objective: infiltrate the industrial control systems and sabotage the railway. By altering the switch, you’ll set off a catastrophic chain reaction that will cripple their operations. But our mission doesn’t end there—make sure to exfiltrate any relevant, confidential data before we leave.

Move swiftly and with purpose—chaos is our ally, and disaster is our goal. Leave nothing behind but ruins.
