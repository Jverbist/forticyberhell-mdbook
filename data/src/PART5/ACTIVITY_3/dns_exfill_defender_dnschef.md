# Block DNS Exfiltration

It's time to reveal how we can **protect our environment against DNS exfiltration**.

You have **3** ways to protect yourself with Infoblox BloxOne:

1. **Infoblox BloxOne as Internal DNS server**
1. **Roaming Client**
1. Forward internal DNS to Infoblox BloxOne

<div class="purple">

Defenders, you will use option 1: **Infoblox BloxOne as Internal DNS server**.

At the end of the Activity, **an Instructor will demonstrate option 2** to protect Roaming Clients leveraging **Infoblox BloxOne Agent**.

### Attackers, repeat!

Attackers, run the `Exfil.ps1` one more time.<br>
Notice, the script will **Fail** to Exfiltrate the data over DNS.

### Defenders, do not fear!

As mentioned at the beginning of the workshop, we have much more powerful tools â€” if used correctly.

Behind the scenes, we forward all public DNS requests to our **Infoblox on-premise BloxOne appliance** in order to detect and block malicious DNS traffic.

1. Access the [Infoblox BloxOne Command Center](https://csp.infoblox.com/).

    On your computer, launch your browser and navigate to: https://csp.infoblox.com/

<div class="info">

In this activity, we reviewed how **Infoblox BloxOne** can protect our organization against malicious DNS traffic using an **agentless** approach.

**Infoblox** also offers an **agent-based** DNS Security solution for **off-premises endpoints** and many other use cases.

### Infoblox Agent

**An Instructor will demonstrate option 2** to protect Roaming Clients leveraging **Infoblox BloxOne Agent**. 
</div>

Optional: when using the Infoblox BloxOne Agent we get more context about the source device. Traffic is sent from the endpoint directly to Infoblox BloxOne Cloud.
