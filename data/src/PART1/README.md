# Introduction


Welcome helldiver, our world is under attack, and we need your help in defending it. 

Let’s set the scene:

Attackers are trying to disrupt public transport in preparation of a global attack. As you just saw, they managed to do it Belgium. Learn from what they did and build defenses, so it won’t happen again. This may be an exercise. But be aware if you fail there will be consequences. 

We will split up into **groups of 2**. Where one of you do the attack and the other will build the defenses.

The mission is clear, **use Exclusive Networks top notch portfolio to detect/block all stages of the attack**. 


## Rules of engagement

<br>

<div class="red">

**Helldivers, you must not engage in any attacks or interference with the environments, accounts, or machines of your fellow defenders**. Stay focused on your mission—our true enemy lies beyond our ranks.

<div class="red">

**Under no circumstances should you target or interfere with machines that are not part of the designated attack and defend flow**. Our battle is with the enemy, not with neutral or unassigned systems.

**Stay vigilant, stay disciplined, and keep your sights set on the real threat.**
