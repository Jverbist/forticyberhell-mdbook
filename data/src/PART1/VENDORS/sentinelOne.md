# SentinelOne Identity Detection & Response
 
Your Shield for Identity-Driven Attacks

### What is SentinelOne Identity Security?
 
SentinelOne Identity Security is an AI-powered solution designed to protect user identities and credentials across your entire environment. In Cyberhell, we use it to detect and stop attackers who try to exploit weak passwords, steal credentials, or move laterally using compromised identities.

### Key Capabilities in Cyberhell Defense
 
Identity Threat Detection & Response (ITDR)
- Monitors user behavior to detect suspicious login attempts and privilege escalation
- Identifies lateral movement and account takeovers in real-time
 
Active Directory Protection
- Defends against Kerberoasting, DCSync, Pass-the-Hash, and other AD-based attacks
- Continuously maps your AD environment to reveal hidden risks
 
Deception-Based Traps
- Deploys fake credentials, users, and services to lure attackers
- Instantly alerts when attackers engage with decoys
 
Ransomware Prevention
- Blocks attackers from using stolen credentials to deploy ransomware
- Integrates with SentinelOne Singularity XDR for end-to-end visibility
 
Zero Trust Enforcement

### Centralized Identity Control
 
Gain deep visibility into identity risks
Enforce real-time responses to stop attackers fast
Simplify compliance with detailed identity reports.
 
In Cyberhell, attackers often move silently—stealing credentials and creeping through the network undetected. SentinelOne Identity Security exposes these tactics, disrupts their movement, and keeps identity-based breaches in check.
 
By using Identity Security, we:
<br>
✅ Catch lateral movement before damage is done.
<br>
✅ Trap attackers with fake accounts and credentials.
<br>
✅ Prevent the spread of malware through stolen identities.
