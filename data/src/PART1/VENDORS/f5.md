# F5 Distributed Cloud Console

> Your Command Center for Cloud-Native Security

### What is F5 Distributed Cloud Console?

F5 Distributed Cloud Console is a Saas-based security and networking platform that provides a unified way to manage, monitor, and secure applications across multi-cloud environments. In Cyberhell, we use it to deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to shield the NMBS website from SQL injection attacks and other web-based threats.

### Key Capabilities in Cyberhell Defense

Advanced Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Protects against SQL Injection (SQLi), XSS, and OWASP Top 10 attacks
- Inspects and blocks malicious requests before they reach the NMBS website

Global Threat Intelligence
- Uses real-time threat feeds and AI-driven analysis to detect attackers before they strike

Multi-Cloud Security
- Deploys across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and on-prem to secure applications everywhere

DDoS Mitigation
- Defends against volumetric and application-layer DDoS attacks
Leverages F5's global network for massive-scale protection

API Protection
- Blocks API abuse and ensures only legitimate traffic reaches critical services

Zero Trust Access
- Enforces strong identity verification before allowing users access to apps

### Centralized Management

Offers a single pane of glass for security orchestration
Enables rapid deployment and policy updates across all sites
Why It Matters in Cyberhell?

In our Cyberhell battlefield, attackers are relentless—using SQL injection to breach NMBS defenses. F5 Distributed Cloud Console stands as our firewall, blocking malicious queries before they reach the database. 

By deploying the F5 WAF, we:
<br>
✅ Prevent data breaches that could expose user credentials
<br> 
✅ Stop attackers from injecting malicious SQL commands
<br> 
✅ Ensure uptime & security for mission-critical applications


### How We Use It in the Workshop
1. Deploy WAF policies through the F5 Distributed Cloud Console
1. Simulate an SQL injection attack on the NMBS website
1. Analyze logs & alerts to see how the attack is blocked
