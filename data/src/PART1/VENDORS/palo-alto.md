## **Use Case in Cybersecurity Training**  
The **PA-460** and **PA-450R** are deployed in our Cyberhell environment. leveraging the Cloud Delivered Security Services (CDSS), to detect and block multiple stages of the Cyberhell-attack, including:  

âœ… **SQL Injection Prevention** â€“ Stops attacks targeting web applications.  
âœ… **Zero-Day Protection** â€“ Detects & blocks unknown exploits before infection.  
âœ… **Command & Control (C2) Attack Disruption** â€“ Identifies & blocks hidden C2 channels.  
âœ… **Lateral Movement & Network Segmentation** â€“ Prevents unauthorized network traversal.  
âœ… **Advanced Reconnaissance Detection** â€“ Flags stealthy attacker techniques.  
âœ… **DNS Data Exfiltration Prevention** â€“ Blocks unauthorized data transfers.  
âœ… **Industrial-Grade Protection for IoT & PLCs** â€“ Detects and stops threats to industrial devices.  
âœ… **AI-Powered Threat Intelligence & MITRE ATT&CK Mapping** â€“ Automates real-time threat response.

## IoT Security

By sending NGFW's logs to IoT Security, we can built an asset inventory, evaluate risk, list and prioritize vulnerabilities, map Network Traffic flows and map devices on the Purdue Model.

# CORTEX: Security Operation Platform 

**Cortex XDR** is Palo Alto Networks **Extended Detection and Response** (**XDR**) platform, designed to detect and respond to advanced threats across endpoints, networks, and cloud environments. 

Cortex XDR correlates data across multiple sources to provide a unified, high-fidelity view of the attack lifecycleâ€”empowering defenders to quickly detect, investigate, and contain threats.

### Cortex XDR benefits
- Block malware, exploits, and fileless attacks with AI-driven endpoint protection.
- Collect and correlate data from any source to detect, triage, investigate, hunt, and respond to threats.
- Simplify investigations with automated root cause analysis and a unified incident magement platform, reducing the number of alerts the SOC team needs to review and lowering the skill required for triage.
- Quickly recover from an attack by removing malicious files and registry keys, using remediation suggestions.

<br>

### **Use Case in Cybersecurity Training**  
In Cyberhell we leverage Cortex XDR to identify and investigate key stages of the attack.
You will explore how Cortex XDR detects:

- Malware execution through behavioral analysis and machine learning.

- Command and Control (C2) communication using threat intelligence and traffic pattern analysis.

- Persistence mechanisms commonly used by attackers to maintain access.

- Discovery activities, including domain enumeration and system probing.

- Lateral movement techniques as attackers pivot through the network.
