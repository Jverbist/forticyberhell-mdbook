# Behind enemy lines

In this second part of our operation, you will dominate the defender's machine. This is where we take the upper hand—by seizing control, you will embed your presence deep within their system, creating persistence that will ensure your access remains hidden in the shadows.

Afterwards, you'll navigate through their network like a phantom, mapping every critical junction and uncovering the pathways that lead to their most guarded secrets.

But the ultimate prize lies ahead—their **OT network**. This is the heart of their operations, the lifeblood of their infrastructure. Once inside, we’ll grip their control systems with an iron fist, twisting their machinery to our will.

This is where the battle shifts in our favor. Be ruthless, be relentless, and carve a path to their downfall. The flames of cyberhell are at your back, driving you forward—let nothing stand in your way.
