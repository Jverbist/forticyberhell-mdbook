# Bridging the Gap: Moving from IT to OT

With a **persistent C2 implant** firmly in place, we’re no longer just intruders—we’re operators. But true dominance lies beyond the IT network. 

**Our next mission?** Crossing into **Operational Technology (OT)**, where critical infrastructure and industrial systems await.

Success depends on stealth and strategy. Use your C2 channel to perform **reconnaissance**, uncover new targets, and execute **lateral movement**. The path won’t be easy, but the reward is total control.

**Good luck—see you on the other side!**
